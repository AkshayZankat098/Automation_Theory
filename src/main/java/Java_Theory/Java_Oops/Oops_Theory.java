        Examples: Students & Students names All classes variable is assigned to object.
     2. Object
     3. Inheritance (Focus on code reusability): Logic of parents and child
     4. Polymorphism:
        Two Types
            > Method overloading
            > Method overriding
     5. Encapsulation: Concepts of overriding and overloading
     6. Abstraction (Focus on code security):
        > Data hiding
        > Encapsulation
        > Tightly coupled classes
        How to achieve Abstraction:
            > Abstract class
            > Interfaces

    7. Data Abstraction (abstract classes, interfaces)

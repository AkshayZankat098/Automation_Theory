What is APIs testing : UI testing (including the behavior of JavaScript pop-up messages) cannot guarantee the functionality of the backend. Therefore, APIs testing is essential.
Focuses on verifying that the backend logic of your application works correctly independently of the user interface:

 1) Data integrity: Does the API return the correct data in the expected format?
 2) Functionality: Do the API endpoints perform their intended actions (e.g., creating, reading, updating, deleting data)?
 3) Error handling: Does the API handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error codes and messages?
 4) Performance: Does the API respond within acceptable timeframes?
 5) Security: Is the API secure against unauthorized access and vulnerabilities?

WorkSpace : Area where we maintain all the files and this saved in sign-in google cloud inside the PostMan.
We can create, rename and delete workspace

Collection : Collection is like a folder that holds a bunch of API requests. Think of it as a way to organize and manage your API tests.
We can create, rename and delete collection , Also If we want to run all APIs then simply Run the whole collection


HTTP Requests :

Request ----------> APIs ----------> Response

1) GET : Retrieve the data from the server or database
